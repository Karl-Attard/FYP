# Final Year Project (FYP) Source Code

## Notebook Files

1. Crime Type Prediction.ipynb
2. Crime Rate Prediction.ipynb

The 'Crime Type Prediction.ipynb' file is the source code responsible for Objective 1 of our research, that of predicting the type of crime. On the other hand, the 'Crime Rate Prediction.ipynb' file is the source code concerning Objective 2 of our research, i.e., forecasting the number of crimes in future years. Finally, the code for Objective 3 (investingating the amount of data our models require to learn on such that their optimal performance is retained) is within these mentioned notebook files respectively.

## Execution of Notebooks

To execute the .ipynb notebooks, first download the relevant datasets from this [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ztXf2oH_vbn_BkMrEhwCu-GEzoHs7xBz). After successfully downloading them, place them in the same repository where the .ipynb files reside. Finally, you are all good to go and can execute every notebook file!
